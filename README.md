# DEEP-LEARNING-BASED-BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION-SYSTEM
A deep learning–based brain tumor detection system uses advanced neural networks to automatically analyze MRI scans, improving accuracy, speed, and early diagnosis compared to manual methods. These systems reduce human error, assist radiologists, and can classify tumor types with high precision.
